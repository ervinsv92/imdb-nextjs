        IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database)[2] is an online database of information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it has been owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
